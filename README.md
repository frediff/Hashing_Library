# Hashing_Library
This is a simple implementation of a library that can be used to create hash-tables with a simple and fast hashing algorithm.
### Usage :
 > ``` HashNode ``` : It is simply a pair of $(key, ~ value)$
 
 > ```Hashtable `` : It is a data structure that stores the HashNodes based on the hashing function $\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1 \]$
